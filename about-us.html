            <p class="text-center">
                At the age of eleven is when I was introduced to “natural remedies.” I grew being in love with horses, and started reading a book series that I followed into adulthood, that used natural remedies in their training methods. That really got me started on looking into the many ways we interact with the natural world around us. For millenia, plants have been used in many different ways, and I believe that has not changed. We have been provided our own eden, if we only look around. 
                
                As a young adult, I started buying books on how to make oils from different plants, and the ways in which we can use those oils. It expanded into how teas were made, the benefits of drinking those different teas, etc. Overtime, my passion for using herbs and flowers in everyday life grew. 
                
                One of my favorite ways of using herbs, is of course, in food! Growing up, my sister and I started learning how to cook, starting with cookies. Eventually, we wanted to learn how to cook almost anything and everything. We now have our tried and true recipes we love making, and that started our dream of creating a space in which we can share those recipes and have a place where we can also create beautiful items that can help others. Whether that be salts for easing those aches and pains, oils to bring a sense of peace and calm to your house, or more decorative items, as well as cooking ingredients. 
                
                This is our dream, that we wanted to share with you. So please look around and enjoy! <br> <br> "McKenzie Tyler"</p>
